# AzureLabs-ServiceBusReceiver

This repository is part of a Hands-On Lab on LinuxAcademy.com, which demonstrates the use of Azure Service Bus. Specifically, these functions listen on a Service Bus queue and topic, and process images saved in Azure Storage according to the message they receive.

Note that while you are free to use this code if you like, it is not designed, nor is it supported, for independent use. It is part of a public repository so that its code can be deployed to an Azure Function via ARM templates.
